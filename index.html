 <h2>So,Lets start by This Topic:<h2><br>
 <h1> WHO IS THE FIRST PROGRAMMER OF THE WORLD????</h1> 



  <p>Ans:</p>
  <p>
  
  
        SHE WAS  ADA LOVELACE. She is considered one of the pioneers of the computer programming concept. The first programmable computer—if it were built—would have been a gigantic, mechanical thing clunking along with gears and levers and punch cards. That was the vision for Analytical Engine devised by British inventor Charles Babbage in 1837. Whereas Babbage is credited with the machine’s conception, it was perhaps his friend Ada Lovelace who best understood its promise and the potential that computers would one day fulfill. The daughter of Romantic poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a gifted mathematician and intellectual who translated an Italian article on the Analytical Engine and supplemented it with extensive notes on the machine’s capabilities. In these notes she not only explained the engine more clearly than Babbage had been able to, but she also described an algorithm it could carry out that is often considered to be the world’s first computer program..She wrote a description of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Her full name was Ada Augusta King, and she was called Countess of Loveless or simply Ada Loveless.
        She was born on December 10,1815 at London, United Kingdom.She had Writed  many books such as  : Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers: A Selection from the Letters of Lord Byron's Daughter and Her Description of the First Computer etc....
        Her children was : Byron King-Noel, Viscount Auckham , Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth , Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace.
        Her parents was  : George Gordon Byron , Ann Isabella Byron.She was a Math and Computer pioneer.The first computer programming language was created in 1883.When AdaLovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine . This is how coding first started.She died on 26 November, 1852, Marylebone, London, United Kingdom from uterine cancer .There was one incident about her,that: At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision. In June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of measles.In 1835,She married William King,and in 1841 she began working on mathematics again, and was given advanced work by Professor Augustus De Morganof University College London.But There was some interesting facts about Her...They are:
        
        
       
       
  <p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>She was the daughter of poet,LORD BYRON..</li>
  <li>The “father of the computer” was her mentor.</li>
  <li>She was excellent in mathematics,science,from her younger age</li>
  <li>  At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualized a flying machine.</li>

 <h1>How does Ada Lovelaces story relate to women in science today?<h1>
  
  <p>Ans:</p>
  <small>



       It’s hard to walk the straight and narrow and follow the perfect path, which 19th-century women had to do. Lovelace reminds me of modern women and their relationship to science in that she’s conflicted about it, [thinking,] “Do I want to go into the humanities or do I want to study math?” She was extremely aware of her oddity as a woman in mathematics; the knowledge that she wasn’t supposed to be doing mathematics was psychologically very difficult to her. And I think a lot of women can relate to that feeling of having to do everything right and being self-conscious in science.<br>
